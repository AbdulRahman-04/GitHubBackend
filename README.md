# GitHubBackend
this is my first ever backend project on GitHub. this project contains private and public api's, where the user or admin can acess the private api's only when they're authorised. the authorisation part is done using JWT authentication and authorization! to know more details on this project, go to the ReamMe.md file in this repository.
